# Onion-Routing-DEMO
A demo of onion routing principals.

## The History of TOR
* The idea of the Onion router was developed b the United States Naval Research Lab employees for use in protectred communications online for US intelligence
* The TOR project was started in 20005 after the reseach lab released the code for TOR
## Use Cases of TOR
* To browse the dark web
* The use of tor is most notiable when wanting to browse the internet without having your ip address shared with the website
While TOR can hide your ip, it can still be found if the packet itself has your ip
* The format of the packets sent can be anything which can allow sites to trace you without you knowing
## Functionality of TOR
* The ISP will see the traffic sent to the entry node and the desitnation service will see the ip address of the exit node
* There is a 3 node chain with encription for each layer to unpack
* Websites can be hosted as an onion services which probvide access only though the onion router
> This services may act as a fouth trusted node which also has an encripted connection to the exit node rather than being sent the packet unencripted as packets to normal sited would be sent.
* You can connect to the tor network without the browser using the standalone tor service which uses **Socks5 proxy**
## Handshake
* When a client connects to TOR network
