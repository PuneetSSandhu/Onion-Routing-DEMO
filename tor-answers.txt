1.  Try passing messages through longer onion routes (more than 3 proxy nodes). What do you notice about the latency? 
    Get a basic time reading, maybe add some time stamps in the code after a the client sends a messages and the proxy 
    relays receive them. If all else fails you can try using your phone's as a stop watch.

2.  Assume that the destination you are accessing doesn't support end-to-end encryption. When passing the message 
    through the onion route, can any of the nodes see the direct message? If any of the nodes can see the traffic, 
    suggest a potential fix.

3.  By default, Tor creates an onion route with 3 nodes between the client and the destination. When passing a message

    Which who communicates directly with who (client, guard, middle, exit, destination)?
